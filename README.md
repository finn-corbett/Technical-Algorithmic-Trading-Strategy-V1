## About <a name="about"></a>

This algorithm is a simple trading strategy, using 2 technical indicators to generate buy and sell signals for a selection of stocks.
There is no live version of this strategy, the 'backtest.py' is the only file for this strategy, as improvements are desired before implementing a live version.

This algorithm is not documented in depth, it is not intended for others to use, it is simply for me to improve my skills and showcase the results.
